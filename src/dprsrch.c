c     Subroutine dprsrch
c
c     This subroutine uses a projected search to compute a step
c     that satisfies a sufficient decrease condition for the quadratic
c
c           q(s) = 0.5*s'*A*s + g'*s,
c
c     where A is a symmetric matrix and g is a vector. Given the 
c     parameter alpha, the step is
c
c           s[alpha] = P[x + alpha*w] - x,
c
c     where w is the search direction and P the projection onto the 
c     n-dimensional interval [xl,xu]. The final step s = s[alpha] 
c     satisfies the sufficient decrease condition
c
c           q(s) <= mu_0*(g'*s),
c
c     where mu_0 is a constant in (0,1).
c
c     The search direction w must be a descent direction for the
c     quadratic q at x such that the quadratic is decreasing
c     in the ray  x + alpha*w for 0 <= alpha <= 1.
c
c	parameters:
c
c       n is an integer variable.

c         On entry x specifies the vector x.
c         On exit x is set to the final point P[x + alpha*w].
c
c       xl is a double precision array of dimension n.
c         On entry xl is the vector of lower bounds.
c         On exit xl is unchanged.
c
c       xu is a double precision array of dimension n.
c         On entry xu is the vector of upper bounds.
